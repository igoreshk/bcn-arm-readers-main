# Environment

To change the environment where you open the project, replace the text from the env file with the text from the `.env` you want to deploy.

The [.env](../.env) file is by default on dev.
if you need to deploy a test environment, copy the text from the [env.testing](../.env.testing) file
If pre-prod - from file [.env.pre-prod](../.env.pre-prod).

**And don't forget to switch branch, if it necessary.**

More about our environments and how to deploy your changes to testing you can see [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/1d626d52-f444-4a8f-bfd0-5539434b9ef5)
